# Pi Guesser

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/927ed6bf-a00a-40a7-8a25-e507191214e6/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/pi-guesser/deploys)

This is a simple SolidJS application to let you guess the digits of pi!

Built on [my livestream](https://www.twitch.tv/cassidoo) just before Pi Day 2022 to try out SolidJS for the first time.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

## Deployment

This is set up to deploy to Netlify! You can clone it and deploy it yourself here:
